I've started this project about 2~3 years ago and it was in an almost-ready state since then. Just when i found some time to finally finish and release it, on the same **day**... 

I've found that it was made obsolete on newer PD Versions because of [this awesome pull request](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/pull/374) that implements those features in PD Vanilla as you can see on [this video](https://vimeo.com/273707442).

Talk about coincidence!

Yet it **still might be useful** if for any reason you are using an older PD version. For example i've found that the HOA Library does not work correctly in newer Vanilla versions. So i've decided to upload it anyway.
